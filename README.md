# How to Analyze a Phishing Email

**Phishing emails are designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information, clicking malicious links, or downloading harmful attachments. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to analyze one:**

# 1. Sender Information

**Check the Sender’s Email Address:**

Look for discrepancies. Phishing emails often use spoofed or slightly altered addresses (e.g., support@paypa1.com instead of support@paypal.com).

**Domain Mismatch:** Verify if the email domain matches the organization it claims to represent. For example, an email claiming to be from Microsoft but sent from microsoft.support@gmail.com is suspicious.

**Display Name Spoofing:** The display name might say “Bank of America,” but the actual email address could be unrelated (e.g., info@randomdomain.xyz).

**Analysis Tip:** Hover over (but don’t click) the sender’s email in your email client to reveal the true address. Cross-check with the official website’s contact details.

# 2. Subject Line
**Urgency or Fear Tactics:** Phishing emails often use alarming subject lines like “Your Account Has Been Hacked!” or “Immediate Action Required.”

**Generic or Vague:** Subjects like “Update Your Information” without specific context can be a red flag.

**Spelling/Grammar Errors:** Minor errors or awkward phrasing may indicate a non-professional source.

**Analysis Tip:** Compare the tone and style with legitimate emails from the same organization. Legitimate companies typically use consistent branding and avoid overly dramatic language.

# 3. Email Content

**Personalization:** Phishing emails may lack personalization (e.g., “Dear Customer” instead of your name) or use incorrect details.

**Urgent Calls to Action:** Phrases like “Click here to verify your account” or “Update your password within 24 hours” pressure you to act without thinking.

**Suspicious Links:** Hover over (don’t click) any links to check the URL. Phishing links often lead to fake domains or shortened URLs (e.g., bit.ly hiding a malicious site).

**Inconsistent Branding:** Look for poor logo quality, unusual fonts, or mismatched colors compared to legitimate emails.

**Grammar and Spelling:** Multiple errors or awkward phrasing are common in phishing attempts.

**Analysis Tip:** Search for the email’s text (or snippets) online to see if others have reported it as a phishing scam. Use a sandbox or URL checker like VirusTotal to inspect links safely.

# 4. Attachments
**Unexpected Files:** Be wary of unsolicited attachments, especially .exe, .zip, or .pdf files, which may contain malware.

**Mismatched File Names:** An attachment named “Invoice.pdf” that’s actually an executable file is a major red flag.

**Analysis Tip:** If you must check an attachment, use a secure virtual machine or sandbox environment. Never open attachments directly from suspicious emails.

# 5. Links and URLs
**Domain Spoofing:** Check if the URL mimics a legitimate site (e.g., amazon-login.net instead of amazon.com).

**HTTPS Misuse:** While HTTPS is secure, phishers use it too. Don’t assume a link is safe just because it has a padlock.

**Redirects or Shortened URLs:** Shortened links (e.g., bit.ly, tinyurl.com) can hide malicious destinations.

**Analysis Tip:** Use a URL expander or safe browsing tool to reveal the full destination of shortened links. Cross-check with the official website.

# 6. Requested Actions
**Sensitive Information Requests:** Legitimate organizations rarely ask for passwords, Social Security numbers, or credit card details via email.

**Login Prompts:** Fake login pages are common phishing destinations. Always navigate to the official website directly instead of clicking email links.

**Financial Requests:** Be cautious of emails asking for payments or donations, especially for unfamiliar causes.

**Analysis Tip:** Contact the organization through official channels (e.g., their website or verified phone number) to confirm any requests.

# 7. Email Headers (Technical Analysis)
**SPF/DKIM/DMARC:** Check the email headers for authentication failures. Phishing emails often fail these checks.

**Return-Path:** The return-path address may differ from the sender’s displayed address, indicating spoofing.

**IP Origins:** Trace the email’s originating IP to see if it’s from an unexpected location (e.g., a foreign server for a local bank).

**Analysis Tip:** Use tools like mxtoolbox.com or emailheaderanalyzer.com to parse headers. Look for inconsistencies in the “Received” fields.

# 8. Context and Timing
**Unsolicited Contact:** Did you expect this email? Unsolicited emails claiming account issues are often phishing attempts.

**Timing Red Flags:** Emails sent at odd hours or following major data breaches may exploit user panic.

**Analysis Tip:** Check recent news or X posts for reports of phishing campaigns targeting the organization in question.
